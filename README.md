# OpenGl Tests

This repository holds a bunch of different (probably random) rendering tests I made using OpenGL. Keep in mind that
while doing all this, I am currently learning OpenGL so most of this is not useful for production anything due to
optimization issues and what not.

But it's a way for me to try things out myself outside the absolutely *amazing* [learnopengl.com
tutorial](http://learnopengl.com).


## Dev

To setup `compile_commands.json`:
```bash
cmake -S . -B build
ln -s build/compile_commands.json .
```
